###This News Feeder is designed to bring Twitter feeds to people that are relevant and pertain to the topics that you love in news, movies,TV, gaming and more....  

###For each topic, there will be sought out experts and those closest to the subject matter to put in one feed to view.

######The client wants to update the feed app (twitter feeds). They would like to add YouTube Instagram and Vine feeds. I have agreed to recreate the app. The present app is difficult to update due to the client using three separate non-programmer frameworks to create the app.

The following is what I was able to complete so far. <br>
I still need to: <br>
* create and map out a json file for categories and topics
* plug feeds from instagram and vine api's
* create a proper wireframe

### Old Viewer
``` markdown
The present news feed app is a great resource but needs to look more attractive to the viewer.
It is a phone app and web app that pulls up curated twitter feeds. You can only access through 
dropdown menus which can feel tedious
```

``` markdown
Old Viewer Home Page
```
